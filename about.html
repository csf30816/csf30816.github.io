            How I Started
          </h2>
          <p>
            I was introduced to coding when I was 10 years old.
            Although I had no interest in it.
            Then a year later in 5<sup>th</sup> grade I was introduced to <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>.
            My teacher said she would teach us how to make webpages at the end of the year, but she didn't.
            So durring the summer I took it to myself to learn.
            I searched the library for it and found out about HTML.
            Then I started to get HTML books and CSS books.
            Eventually having a vast knowledge of coding, enough so I could learn other languages like JS, PHP, and SQL.

            What I do
          </h2>
          <p>
            I spend most of my time studing and completing school, although in my spare time I play around with the <a href="https://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Cloud">Scratch Cloud</a>.
            I also moderate <a href="http://frvp.cf">Free VistaPanel</a>, and make random projects and designs (which I sometimes share <a href="behance.net/csf30816b05a">here</a>).
            My family really enjoys the ever-so-popular game <a href="http://moomoo.io/">moomoo.io</a> although really I never had a interest in it.
            We usually play in a team named <m>MAGA</m> with the members <m>SLUGGY/MALICE</m>, <m>Hey O!</m>, <m>LORD OF DISPAIR</m>, and <m>IceIceBaby/PotatoPeeler (Me)</m>.

            I do "know" some "people" on the internet that I get along with and talk to enough to call them "frinds".
            You can find some of those people <a href="/friends.html">here</a>.
